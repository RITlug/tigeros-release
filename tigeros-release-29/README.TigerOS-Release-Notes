README.Generic-Release-Notes
=============================

TigerOS is now using Fedora 29! Changes include gnome-shell 3.30, and updated
RPM packages.

In TigerOS 29, the dark-theme has been deprecated in favor of a lighter theme
to match current GNOME progress.

Furthermore, several more wallpapers have been added.
